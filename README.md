## Portfolio Projects & Project Reviews

Each major section of the curriculum concludes with a comprehensive Portfolio Project meant to demonstrate your learnings, where you will conduct an analysis from start to finish. For each project, you’ll complete a 1:1 Project Review to ensure that you’ve mastered key concepts before progressing to the next section. Cohort Leads are ready to provide additional mentorship if you need help deepening your understanding.

Throughout the course, you will be required to complete five Portfolio Projects, each with a unique set of technical requirements. Full-time students should plan to spend 5-7 days on each project, and part-time students, about 2 weeks on each project.

Project Reviews are pass/fail (not numerically graded) and are used to evaluate your readiness to progress to the next Section. During a Project Review, you will be asked to show and discuss what you have built. Expect to walk through your project, and be comfortable answering questions about your process, as well as other concepts covered in the curriculum. A list of the project requirements and topics to be covered can be found in each project lesson. You will pass your project review if:

1. You have built a project that meets the technical requirements;
2. You can explain in detail what your code is doing and how it works;
3. You can satisfactorily demonstrate understanding of the core concepts from previous portions of the course

You will be informed at the end of the project review session whether you have passed or not. If you do not pass the review satisfactorily on your first attempt, you will have the opportunity to reschedule the review.

Note: All students will be given two attempts to pass a Portfolio Project review within two weeks of the project due date. If you’re unable to pass the review within two weeks of the project due date, you will be required to repeat the module in full or you will be dismissed from the program in accordance with the policies outlined in the “Satisfactory Academic Progress” and “Academic Probation” sections in the Flatiron School Catalog, which can be viewed by clicking on “View the full United States catalog” here: https://flatironschool.com/north-america-regulatory-information/.
